# Meet the Pilcrow!

Say hello to the [Pilcrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilcrow), aka the paragraph symbol, aka unicode character 00B6.

In the Middle Ages, the pilcrow was put to work. Back then, this funny little mark was used to break up individual trains of thought while writing.

As time went on, the pilcrow moved itself over to the left side of the page. Paragraphs started on a new line and were annotated with a pilcrow. The pilcrow was often decorative and was typically added after the rest of the text was complete. Because of this, scribes would leave a space at the beginning of a paragraph where they would come back and add an pilcrow.

As texts were produced at a faster rate, and especially after the development of the printing press, it got harder to find time to go back and fill in the space at the start of a paragraph. Because of this, the pilcrow fell out of style, but it's home, the indentation at the beginning of a paragraph, lives on.

You can add pilcrows to your Jekyll site today. It's as easy as adding this plugin to your Gemfile:

```
group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem 'jekyll_pilcrow_converter'
end
```

With this plugin, you get these neat little links to the left of all of your paragraphs. These are anchors that allow you to link directly to a paragraph on your page. Good stuff!
